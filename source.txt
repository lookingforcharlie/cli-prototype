1 - Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome
2 - Has many sonnets: so here now shall be
3 - One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me
4 - To her whose heart is my heartâ€™s quiet home,
5 - To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee
6 - I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;
7 - Whose service is my special dignity,
8 - And she my loadstar while I go and come
9 - And so because you love me, and because
10 - I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath
